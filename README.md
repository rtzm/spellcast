This project is currently under development.

Currently, creating the algorithm to turn optical flow vectors into lines generated on the client-side. Next, I will make a user interface to capture video and display those generated lines.

To launch the project, clone it down and run ```npm install```. It will have server capabilities in the future once the main algorithm is established and a user interface is created.
